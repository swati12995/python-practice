dictionaries use a key-value pair.
The key-value pair allows users to quickly grab objects withit needing to know an index location
It uses curly braces and colons to signify the keys and their associated values.
{'key1':'value','key2':'value2'}

it can't be sorted

my_dict = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}
